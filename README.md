# ProgSnap2 Data Analysis

This reposity contains scripts for data analysis on a [ProgSnap2](bit.ly/ProgSnap2) dataset.

Current analyses include:

## Compile Error Metrics

These analyze students' compilation behavior to create a single numerical metric that can be used to predict course success.

These currently include:
* **The Error Quotient** ([eq.py][eq.py]). Jadud, M. C. (2006). Methods and tools for exploring novice compilation behaviour. In Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Computing Education Research (pp. 73â€“84). https://doi.org/10.1145/1151588.1151600

Each of these files takes 2 command line arguments:
1) The path to ProgSnap2 repository (e.g. if you pass in "data" it will look for "data/MainTable.csv")
2) The path for the output csv file (including the name of the file)

If these are not supplied, it will defualt to "./data" and "./out/EQ.csv".

## Dependencies

* Pandas
